enforce policy compliance
mitigate config errors (security and governance violations)
shift to IaC => increasing significance of errors
    also compliance e.g. which region data can be created in
constraints
"gcloud beta terraform vet"
    compliance as part of cicd pipeline
    detect policy violations
    != terraform validate
        used to test syntax / structure without deploying
        vs. ensuring config satisfies constraints
use cases
    add guardrails to ci/cd to ensure requests are validated before deployment
        indicate which policies were violated
    application teams can validate against policy libraries to ensure compliance

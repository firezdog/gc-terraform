resource: defines infra components
    resource "resource_type" "resource_name" {
        # resource args
    }
    "resource" keyword
example: storage bucket + compute instance
providers implement resource types
    providers.tf specifies what providers will be used
    expose apis as terraform resources, manage interactions
    configs belong in root module
    each providers has source and version
        version is optional (prevent breaking changes)
        use of most recent if no version
    each provider is then configured in another block
variables parameterize config
    inputs for customization
    values set at runtime (env, cli, etc.)
        variables <=> tfvars
    outputs.tf -- output values
        computed attributes
        listed after apply
    tfstate
        saved state
        can be stored locally or remotely
        created / updated automatically
    module
        config files in single directory
        primary method of code reuse
        specify source from which code is retrieved (local / remote)
            use of module registry or creation of bespoke
